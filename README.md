# BasicBank
Back end of a basic bank. The API is implemented using Entity Framework and repository flow. In this API, the user authentication is not present, so all the data of the database are able to be accessed freely. The purpose of the API is to show the repository flow logic, meaning the extra layer of abstraction between the Controller and database connections caused by an interface. (Also, a single user is capable of having only a single account and a single loan for the sake of simplicity.)
